# HW4: Support Vector Machine
## Goals
- Implement the gram_matrix function to compute the Gram matrix of the given data with an argument kernel_function to specify which kernel function to use.
- Implement the linear_kernel function to compute the value of the linear kernel between two vectors.
- Implement the polynomial_kernel function to compute the value of the polynomial kernel between two vectors with an argument degree.
- Implement the rbf_kernel function to compute the value of the rbf kernel between two vectors with an argument gamma.
