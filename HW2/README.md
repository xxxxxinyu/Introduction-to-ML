# HW2: Logistic Regression & Fisher’s Linear Discriminant

## Goals

### Logistic Regression
- Use Gradient Descent to update your model
- Use CE (Cross-Entropy) as your loss function.

### Fisher’s Linear Discriminant
Implement FLD to reduce the dimension of the data from 2-dimensional to 1-dimensional.
